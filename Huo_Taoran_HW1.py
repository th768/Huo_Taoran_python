#Overall Comment: Generally speaking, I think it is a very good start of Python! There are still some detailed mistakes you need
#to pay attention, but you still have time. Here is my suggestion: Always take the logic in the first place, the function you defined
#is really working, but the logic seems not that efficient. You need to devote some time in this aspect. But you commended very
#well, it is a good habit for programming. My comment has started with Comment:, you may have a look. If you think there is
#any misunderstanding, please feel free to email me.

    '''
1. Define a function max()that takes two numbers as arguments and
