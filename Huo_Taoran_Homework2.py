def splitter(file):
    '''
    11. A sentence splitter is a program capable of splitting a text into
    sentences. The standard set of heuristics for sentence splitting
    includes (but isn't limited to) the following rules:
    Sentence boundaries occur at one of "." (periods), "?" or "!", except
    that
    a. Periods followed by whitespace followed by a lower case letter
    are not sentence boundaries.
    b. Periods followed by a digit with no intervening whitespace are
    not sentence boundaries.
    c. Periods followed by whitespace and then an upper case letter,
    but preceded by any of a short list of titles are not sentence
    boundaries. Sample titles include Mr., Mrs., Dr., and so on.
    d. Periods internal to a sequence of letters with no adjacent
    whitespace are not sentence boundaries (for example,
    www.aptex.com, or e.g).
    e. Periods followed by certain kinds of punctuation (notably comma
    and more periods) are probably not sentence boundaries.
    Your task here is to write a program that given the name of a text
    file is able to write its content with each sentence on a separate
    line. Test your program with the following short text: Mr. Smith
    bought cheapsite.com for 1.5 million dollars, i.e. he paid a lot for it.
    Did he mind? Adam Jones Jr. thinks he didn't. In any case, this isn't
    true... Well, with a probability of .9 it isn't. The result should be:
